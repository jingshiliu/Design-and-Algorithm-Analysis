# Design-and-Algorithm-Analysis

This repo contains the code of projects and exam questions.

Each folder is a directory for a project.

For C++ projects, a main.cpp contains all the code. Even though it is not a best practice to include all the class and code in one file, it's how I was told to submit.

For JAVA projects, code is in the src folder.
